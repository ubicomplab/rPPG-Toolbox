# Preprocessing Visualization Tool

In this folder, we provide an interactive Jupyter notebook to visualize data preprocessed by this toolbox. The notebook, `viz_preprocessed_data.ipynb`, automatically will detect the type of preprocessed data generated by this toolbox and then provide a frame-by-frame visualization of the data, alongside the corresponding plot of ground truth label.

Below is an example of what the visualization looks like:
